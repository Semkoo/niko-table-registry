# Niko Table

> Niko Table is a composable, shadcn-compatible data table component registry built with TanStack Table, React, and Tailwind CSS. It follows an open-code philosophy — install components into your project and own the code. Features include sorting, filtering, pagination, row selection, row expansion, column pinning, drag-and-drop (row and column), virtualization, server-side data, and URL state management. AI-Ready by design.

## Architecture

- Two-layer component system: context-aware (`DataTable*` prefix, auto-connect via `useDataTable()`) and direct-prop (`Table*` prefix, accept `table` prop).
- Three-layer DnD architecture: low-level primitives (filters/) → context-aware wrappers (components/) → structure components (core/).
- Built on TanStack Table for state management, @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop, @tanstack/react-virtual for virtualization.
- Components are distributed via the shadcn registry CLI: `npx shadcn@latest add https://niko-table.com/r/data-table.json`

- [Component Overview](https://niko-table.com/niko-table/components): High-level directory of all components organized by category.
- [DataTable Introduction](https://niko-table.com/niko-table/introduction): Deep dive into the DataTable component system and composition patterns.
